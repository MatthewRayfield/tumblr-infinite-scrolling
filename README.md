# Tumblr Infinite Scrolling Script
( Modified to work in 2019 ) ( last updated: August 16th 2019 )

Many people use the Tumblr infinite scrolling script by Cody Sherman, but his page is dead and the script itself has also stopped working with a Tumblr update. I made a very small tweak to it and now it appears to work just fine.

If you are adding infinite scrolling for the first time, just add the script tag below to the bottom of your theme body. Or swap out the old script tag for this one if you already had it in your theme.

```
<script src="https://matthewrayfield.github.io/tumblr-infinite-scrolling/infinitescrolling.js"></script>
```

If it stops working please let me know.
